A great 80 track demo in Sixpacked zipfile-format.
Sixpack is a special form of c64 filezip.
Use the included Tool Zip/UnZip and choose "6"

I checked it on 2 1541 drives,old and new,so this is the 100% version,i hope :)
Don`t forget that you need 2 empty disksides for ONE demo-side,cause of the 
special way Sixpack handle the files.
